# DeepFake-Detection
This repository contains a deep learning-based framework for detecting deepfake images. 
The model leverages GAN-generated data and CNN-based architectures to distinguish between real and fake images with high accuracy. The project includes:

Custom Dataset: A custom FaceSwap dataset generated using Inswapper to train and validate the models.
Model Architecture: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction combined with style and content features for robust detection.
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score to assess model performance.
Preprocessing: Image preprocessing, including resizing, normalization, and augmentation techniques for improving detection accuracy.
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning in combating misinformation and fake media by detecting AI-generated fake images.
